    // Heap allocated - the memory used by a vector is heap allocated and can therefore grow and shrink at runtime.
    // Own their data elements.
    //
    // Length - vectors have a length which says how many elements are in the container.
    // Capacity - vectors have a capacity which could be larger than the length.
    // Changing the capacity can involve quite a bit of work to allocate a new region of memory and move all of the data into that region.
    //
    // Mulitplication factor:
    // As you add elements to a vector, capacity grows by a multiplicative factor
    // Done to reduce frequency.
    // Biggest advantage: Size of the vector is expandable; the length is not part of the type.
    //

    // Slices
    // A key type that comes in handy to alleviate some of the limitations of arrays is the std::slice.
    // Slices are a dynamically sized view into a sequence.
    // Therefore, you can have a slice which references an array or a vector and treat them the same.

 * Functions
 * Inputs passed by value.

 *
 * Modes: Different modes of passing arguments to functions.
 * Borrowing:
 *  - Function can temporarily have acces to variable (borrowing).
 * Ownership:
 *  - Functions can have ownership of a variable.
 *  - Default function take input by value and hence ownership of the variable is moved into the function.
 *
 * Another dimension is whether the function can mutate the input.
 *
 * Copy
 * Trait
 * If type implements a special trait called Copy, input is copied into the function and therefore the caller still maintains ownership of the variable.
 * If the element type of an array implements the Copy trait, then the array type also implements the Copy trait.
